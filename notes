Terms:
 oop - a pointer into a GC managed heap.

parallelScavengeHeap.hpp
	A heap for the parallelScavenge GC (inherits from Collected Heap).
	Very important start point for reading a GC implementation.
	It has all the main components needed for the GC.
	Some important methods:
	-> collect: Used to support System.gc(). This will result in several 
	function calls before ending up calling either: invoke_scavenge or 
	do_full_collection;
	-> do_full_collection
	-> invoke: this will redirect the call to psScavenge. This is where
	this get real interesting.

psYoungGen.hpp
	Young generation of the Generational GC. It contains the respective
	spaces: from, to, eden, and has several funtions to get statiscs for
	example.

psOldGen.hpp
	Similar to the young generation.

mutableSpace.hpp
	Represents a segment of memory.
	Contains several functions that can perform memory operations.
	Can iterate oops and objects.
