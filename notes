Terms:
 oop - a pointer into a GC managed heap.
 mt  - multy thread
 lab - local allocation buffer?

Side notes:
 - there is one promotion manager per GC worker thread.

parallelScavengeHeap.hpp
	A heap for the parallelScavenge GC (inherits from Collected Heap).
	Very important start point for reading a GC implementation.
	It has all the main components needed for the GC.
	Some important methods:
	-> collect: Used to support System.gc(). This will result in several 
	function calls before ending up calling either: invoke_scavenge or 
	do_full_collection;
	-> do_full_collection
	-> invoke: this will redirect the call to psScavenge. This is where
	this get real interesting.

psScavenge.[c|h]pp
	invoke: entry point for GC. Performs a minor GC 
	(through invoke_no_policy) and then calls compact or ms GCs if a full
	collection is necessary.
	invoke_no_policy: this method performs a young copy collector. It has
	a lot of statistics/state/auxiliary stuff. The most important part
	goes as follows:
		1. create tasks to search heap roots. This will mark/copy the
		root objects;
		2. process found references. TODO - reading

psYoungGen.hpp
	Young generation of the Generational GC. It contains the respective
	spaces: from, to, eden, and has several funtions to get statiscs for
	example.

psOldGen.hpp
	Similar to the young generation.

mutableSpace.hpp
	Represents a segment of memory.
	Contains several functions that can perform memory operations.
	Can iterate oops and objects.

universe.hpp
	This is a special file which comprehends many important concepts: 
	objects, heap, etc. Read better later.
